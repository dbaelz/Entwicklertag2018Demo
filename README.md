## About this project
This is a demo project with examples for some Kotlin language features and
there usage in combination with Android.

This code is in parts the live demo of my German speaking talk
`Kotlin für Android-Entwickler` (Kotlin for Android Developer) at the
[Entwicklertag Karlsruhe 2018](https://entwicklertag.de/karlsruhe/2018/kotlin-f-r-android).
The few slides are included as PDF.
